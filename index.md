## Description
The purpose of this course is to provide graduate students with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills for the analysis of high throughput sequence data. The course will entail data retrieval and assembly, alignment techniques, variant calling, gene expression analyses, hypothesis testing, and population genomic and phylogenomic approaches. The course will be presented as a series of short lectures and lab exercises over a one week period during the mid semester break of the second semester.

## Instructors
Dr. Kathryn Hodgins, Dr. Gregory Owens, Dr. Matt McGee, Dr. Sonika Tyagi

## Format
A mix of lecture and tutorial exercises running in a 2-hour block.

## Prequisites
Prior exposure to R and Unix command line is recommended. However, we will be running a crash course on command line the first day. 

## Lectures/tutorials
30 Sept 2019 â€“ 4 Oct 2019
10am to Noon, 1pm to 3pm


## Where
Room 144 (Digilabs), Building 17 School of Biological Sciences


## Basic course structure

The course material is organized in several topics, with slides and coding examples.

To get up to speed on working with a Unix system, take a look at the [unix help](resources/unix_ref.pdf) file. There are some resources there that will help you find the specific command you need for each task.

## Obtaining all the files on this site

To access the course content offline, you may download an up-to-date
snapshot archive of the site content from this location:
https://github.com/khodgins/Bioinformatics_Introduction/archive/master.zip

But the recommended approach is to use `git` which tracks changes and supports incremental updates:

    git clone https://github.com/khodgins/Bioinformatics_Introduction.git

If the course content changes, you can update your local copy by going into to the **Bioinformatics_Introduction** directory that was created by the previous command and invoking the command:

    git pull
