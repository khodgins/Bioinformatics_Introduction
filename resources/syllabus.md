Hands on Workshop: Introduction to Bioinformatics

## DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this course is to provide graduate students with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills for the analysis of high throughput sequence data. The course will entail data retrieval and assembly, alignment techniques, variant calling, gene expression analyses, hypothesis testing, and population genomic and phylogenomic approaches. The course will be presented as a series of short lectures and lab exercises over a one week period during the mid semester break of the second semester.

## INSTRUCTORS

Dr. Kathryn Hodgins, Dr. Gregory Owens, Dr. Matt McGee, Dr. Sonika Tyagi

## FORMAT

AA mix of lecture and tutorial exercises running in a 2-hour block.

## PREREQUISITES

Prior exposure to R and Unix command line is recommended. However, we will be running a crash course on command line the first day.
